<title>SUMMARY</title><p>Hippo-YAP signaling orchestrates epithelial tissue repair and is therefore an attractive target in regenerative medicine. Yet it is unresolved how YAP controls the underlying transient proliferative response. Here we show that YAP-TEAD activation increases the nuclear cyclin D1/p27 protein ratio in G1 phase, towards a threshold level that dictates whether individual cells enter or exit the cell cycle. YAP increases this ratio indirectly, by increasing EGFR and other receptor activities that signal primarily through ERK. Conversely, contact inhibition suppresses YAP activity which gradually downregulates mitogen signaling and the cyclin D1/p27 ratio. Increasing YAP activity by ablating the suppressor Merlin/NF2 reveals a robust balancing mechanism in which YAP can still be inhibited after cell division further increases local cell density. Thus, critical for tissue repair, the proliferation response is intrinsically transient since the YAP-induced and mitogen-mediated increase in the cyclin D1/p27 ratio is reliably reversed through delayed contact inhibition of YAP.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Acute chemical and physical injury inactivates the Hippo pathway, which activates the transcriptional cofactor YAP to increase proliferation, along with inducing metabolic changes and matrix remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. YAP activation initiates transcription by binding TEAD and other nuclear transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. While YAP and its paralog TAZ are dispensable for the basal proliferation of several tissues, they are crucial for regeneration and repair following injury in tissues such as skin, liver, and kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Inhibitors of Hippo pathway proteins are therefore being developed for potential clinical use in tissue repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Hippo signaling is kept active in epithelial sheets and other tissues by cell-cell contacts, such as adherens and tight junctions, and is inactivated by mechanical stress during tissue repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Adaptor proteins like Merlin (NF2) contribute to contact inhibition signaling to activate LATS1/2, which is the principal kinase of the Hippo pathway suppressing YAP-TEAD activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Consequently, loss of LATS activity leads to dramatic increases in the size of tissues and organs, and tumorigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Despite the general finding that YAP activation promotes proliferation, the mechanism how YAP initiates cell cycle entry is unresolved.</p>
<p>Different mechanisms have been described through which YAP signaling could increase proliferation. Constitutive YAP activation increases expression of a broad array of cell cycle genes, including DNA replication factors and regulators of G2/M progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. YAP also promotes secretion of mitogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and cooperates with AP-1 transcription factors in inducing target genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Likewise, cell cycle entry is regulated by both receptor signaling and contact inhibition, which may signal independently of YAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, cell cycle entry is ultimately controlled by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity in G1 phase which must phosphorylate and inactivate retinoblastoma protein (Rb), the suppressor of the cell cycle transcription factor E2F. How YAP controls Rb phosphorylation in G1 is not established: YAP could induce cell cycle entry by directly regulating cyclin D, indirectly through regulating mitogen signaling, or by reprogramming the cell state.</p>
<p>As persistent YAP activation induces organ hyperplasia and cancer, YAP-TEAD must also be robustly inactivated after the tissue repair is completed. Hippo-dependent and Hippo-independent pathways have been described that can inactivate YAP through phosphorylation, cytoplasmic sequestration, and degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. The complexity of both the proliferation initiation and termination, together with additional roles of YAP in cell differentiation and cell metabolism, has made it challenging to use animal models to determine how Hippo-YAP signaling coordinates a proliferation response that must be transient, generating only the cells needed to recover the original tissue size during repair.</p>
<p>Here we use multiplexed, single-cell immunofluorescence analysis to examine YAP-regulated proliferation in thousands of epithelial cells in a monolayer. We show that over a wide range of stimuli, proliferation is controlled through a balance mechanism whereby mitogen signaling is opposed by contact inhibition suppressing YAP activity. YAP activation drives proliferation by both increasing the nuclear ratio of the protein level of cyclin D1 and decreasing the level of the CDK inhibitor p27. Strikingly, YAP-activated cells only enter the cell cycle if the cyclin D1/p27 ratio exceeds a critical threshold level during the G1 phase, whereas cells arrest the cell cycle below this threshold. YAP activation increases this cyclin D1/p27 ratio indirectly by increasing the activity of EGFR and other surface receptors, which in turn signal primarily through MEK-ERK, rather than the often-implicated mTOR pathway. Ensuring a strong proliferation response, this inactivation of YAP downregulated EGFR signaling to lower the cyclin D1/p27 ratio, but only after a delay. Ensuring robust YAP signal termination, even a strong increase in YAP activity generated by ablation of the upstream Hippo component Merlin could still be reversed by contact inhibition-mediated YAP inactivation, but only at higher local cell density. Together, our study identifies a balancing mechanism centered on an increase and delayed decrease in the cyclin D1/p27 ratio that makes YAP-induced proliferation intrinsically transient, which is essential for generating a commensurate number of new cells during repair.</p>

<title>Contact inhibition of YAP opposes mitogen stimulation in a balance mechanism controlling cell proliferation</title>
<p>Even within epithelial monolayers subject to the same mitogen stimuli, there is considerable heterogeneity in cell cycle signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. We therefore used single cell analysis to distinguish between various plausible mechanisms of how YAP activation might be linked to contact inhibition and mitogen signaling to control cell cycle entry. While YAP and TAZ both promote proliferation, we focus here primarily on YAP as it is generally the limiting component in regulating proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. We used hTERT-immortalized human retinal pigmented epithelial cells (RPE1) that reversibly arrest the cell cycle with serum starvation or contact inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. We use the terms &#x201C;contact inhibition&#x201D; and &#x201C;local cell density&#x201D; interchangeably since the local cell density in monolayers closely predicts whether proliferation is suppressed in individual RPE1 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. We used different concentrations of serum (fetal bovine) to understand the role of mitogens in the process.</p>
<p>We quantified local cell density by subdividing segmented nuclei for each image into a 10 x 10 grid (&#x223C;75 x 75 &#x03BC;m) and counting the cells within each block (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Each cell was then assigned its local density based on the number of cells in its block (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>, see also STAR Methods). To assess changes in proliferation, we measured both phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (p-Rb, S807/811), which is a bimodal marker of cyclin-CDK activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> that is low in arrested cells and remains high in cycling cells from G1 through mitosis, and EdU incorporation into DNA, which occurs during DNA replication in S phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, S1B).</p>

</fig>
<p>We first confirmed that increasing the mitogen stimulus from low (0.1&#x0025; serum) and intermediate (1&#x0025; serum) to high (10&#x0025; serum) levels increased the percentage of proliferating cells using both metrics of proliferation, p-Rb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) and EdU (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>). The proportion of proliferating cells progressively decreased as local cell density increased for high and low serum levels, supporting that mitogen signaling and contact inhibition oppose each other in regulating proliferation. This conclusion was also supported by an alternative metric of local cell density that was based on the area of neighboring cell nuclei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> within a radius of similar scaling (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D</xref>). This inverse regulation represents an intuitive balancing mechanism: the inhibition of proliferation at a given cell density can be overcome by increasing mitogen signaling, and the increase in proliferation after increasing mitogen signaling can be antagonized once cell division has increased local cell density.</p>
<p>We next determined how YAP activity changes this balance between mitogen signaling and contact inhibition by stably expressing a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible, constitutively active YAP variant (5 regulatory serines mutated to alanine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, CA-YAP). As leaky expression of CA-YAP (without DOX induction) was sufficient to increase proliferation (at a similar expression level compared to the endogenous YAP, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1E</xref>), we did not use DOX induction unless otherwise stated. Even with this weaker YAP expression, the cell density dependence of proliferation was abolished in CA-YAP cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), demonstrating that contact inhibition of proliferation requires contact inhibition of YAP activity. Moreover, CA-YAP cells retained mitogen sensitivity independent of contact inhibition since increasing serum levels further increased the percentage of proliferating cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, S1F).</p>
<p>We next tested whether contact inhibition and mitogen signaling regulate endogenous YAP activity. As the ratio of the nuclear to cytoplasmic (n/c) YAP and the absolute nuclear level of YAP are both relative measures of YAP activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, we measured both parameters as a function of local cell density (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, see also STAR Methods). At 0.1&#x0025; serum, we observed the expected inhibition of YAP at increasing cells density when monitoring the YAP n/c ratio or the nuclear YAP level. At 1&#x0025; and 10&#x0025; serum, the YAP n/c ratio was diminished at higher cell densities, but the nuclear level of YAP was higher than for low serum conditions.</p>
<p>We used this single-cell data to analyze the percent of cells with phosphorylated Rb as a function of the relative YAP activity. Markedly, using both metrics, increasing serum levels increased proliferation for cells with identical YAP levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, YAP activation and mitogen stimuli synergistically increase proliferation, and exogenously added mitogens increase proliferation directly without requiring increased YAP.</p>
<p>Finally, we determined how acute increases and decreases in YAP activity regulate Rb phosphorylation. Using recently developed inhibitors, we inhibited YAP-TEAD signaling with a pan-TEAD inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and activated endogenous YAP using a LATS1/2 inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. We confirmed that TEAD inhibition promoted a strong cytoplasmic localization of endogenous YAP while LATS inhibition triggered its nuclear enrichment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). TEAD inhibition greatly reduced the fraction of proliferating cells for low but not for high serum stimuli, suggesting that YAP-TEAD activity is particularly critical for inducing proliferation for low mitogen stimulation conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, S1G). Conversely, LATS inhibition greatly boosted proliferation at low serum stimuli and had a smaller relative effect at high serum stimuli due to the already high percentage of proliferating cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1H</xref>). Finally, this analysis showed that high mitogens can induce proliferation independently of YAP-TEAD activity since TEAD inhibition could reverse the portion of proliferation induced by YAP but not a YAP-independent component of mitogen-induced proliferation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these experiments strongly support a model that contact inhibition of YAP activity and mitogen signaling compete to respectively suppress or promote proliferation over a wide range of cell densities and mitogen stimuli. However, this balance can be broken in two ways: by high mitogen stimuli inducing proliferation in cells lacking YAP-TEAD activity and persistent activation of YAP abolishing contact inhibition of proliferation.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>YAP-regulated cell cycle entry and exit is dictated by a cyclin D1/p27 threshold</title>
<p>We next used the quantitative analysis of the balance between contact inhibition and mitogen signaling to identify the mechanism of how YAP regulation controls cell-cycle entry and exit. Cells enter the cell cycle during the G1 phase by activating cyclin-CDK complexes to hyperphosphorylate Rb and derepress the E2F cell cycle transcription program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. In contrast, in cells that exit the cell cycle or stay arrested, cyclin-CDKs stay inactive and Rb remains dephosphorylated. In monolayers of RPE1 and other epithelial cells, this bimodal Rb phosphorylation is thought to be primarily controlled by the CDK4/6 activator cyclin D1 and the cyclin-CDK2/4/6 inhibitor p27<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, and cyclin D1 is generally thought to contribute to the YAP-mediated proliferation regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. We included p27 in our analysis since both cyclin D1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and p27 are key regulators of cell proliferation in vivo, with p27 deletion resulting in multi-organ hyperplasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Using multiplexed immunofluorescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, we computationally gated for G1 cells by their diploid 2N DNA content and lack of incorporation of EdU (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>). We then measured the levels of nuclear localized cyclin D1 and p27 and whether Rb was phosphorylated in each G1-phase cell. Notably, p27 protein levels are often used as a marker of non-proliferating cells, but we observed substantial heterogeneity in the nuclear levels of both p27 and cyclin D1 across individual cells irrespective of Rb phosphorylation (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>). Increasing the mitogen stimulus (from 0.1&#x0025; to 10&#x0025; serum) resulted in the cell population shifting towards higher average cyclin D1 levels and lower average p27 levels.</p>
<p>We next determined how local cell density and YAP activity regulate the cyclin D1 and p27 levels. As local density increased, the median cyclin D1 level of WT cells gradually decreased, while the median p27 level strongly increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). This trend was opposite to the effects of increasing serum, which both globally increased cyclin D1 levels and suppressed the density-dependent increase in p27 protein. Markedly, the CA-YAP cells lost the serum and density dependence of both, keeping the levels of cyclin D1 high and p27 low in G1 phase, arguing that YAP activity is not only upregulating the level of cyclin D1 but also downregulating the level of p27 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>Explaining why the level of cyclin D1 or p27 alone cannot predict whether Rb is phosphorylated, only the level of cyclin D1 relative to p27 was tightly correlated with Rb phosphorylation in individual cells. Only cells with relatively more cyclin D1 than p27 had Rb phosphorylated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-D</xref>, S2C). Thus, even for low mitogen levels, a small fraction of cells had sufficiently high cyclin D1 and low p27 to have Rb phosphorylated. Conversely, at high mitogen stimulation, more cells populated the high-cyclin D1/low-p27 state and had Rb phosphorylated, demonstrating a critical threshold cyclin D1/p27 ratio for proliferation.</p>
<p>Strikingly, in CA-YAP cells with persistently active YAP, Rb phosphorylation remained closely predicted by the relative nuclear cyclin D1 and p27 levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, S2D-E), implying that YAP is signaling through both cyclin D1 and p27 to control proliferation. Notably, we identified some CA-YAP cells with high cyclin D1 that did not have Rb phosphorylated, but these cells had increased protein levels of another CDK inhibitor, p21, which we demonstrated in separate experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Since p21 levels were only weakly regulated by serum starvation or contact inhibition (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2F-G</xref>), p27 is functioning as the primary proliferation suppressor relevant for contact inhibition and YAP signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The fundamental role of the cyclin D1/p27 ratio in YAP-regulated proliferation is further seen in a comparison of different perturbations that change the cyclin D1/p27 ratio and correspondingly change Rb phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). The siRNA-mediated knockdown of cyclin D1 strongly reduced the proportion of cells with phosphorylated Rb by shifting most of the CA-YAP cells to a high-p27 and quiescent state, but again preserved the control of Rb phosphorylation by the cyclin D1/p27 ratio (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, S2H). Moreover, knocking down p27 in WT cells resulted in more cells ending up below the dashed line but still preserved the control of Rb phosphorylation by the cyclin D1/p27 ratio (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Conversely, in cells where p27 levels were increased by CRISPRa induction, most cells were above the dashed line and proliferation was completely suppressed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). However, LATS inhibitor-mediated activation of YAP in these cells lowered p27 and increased cyclin D1 to push some cells below the threshold cyclin D1/p27 ratio where they could again proliferate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>).</p>
<p>We conclude that the crucial parameter for the YAP-regulated control of cell cycle entry is the nuclear cyclin D1/p27 ratio in G1 phase, with a threshold dictating whether individual cells enter or exit the cell cycle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). Moreover, YAP activity and mitogen signaling both control proliferation through the same downstream cyclin D1/p27 ratio. Notably, we were only able to identify this molecular mechanism of how YAP controls the cell cycle entry and exit decision by measuring nuclear p27, cyclin D1 and p-Rb levels within the same, G1-gated single cell.</p>

<p>Previous studies suggested various regulatory mechanisms, such as direct induction of cyclin D1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, indirect induction of mitogen signaling, or reprogramming the cell state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.

<p>We confirmed that the conserved YAP target gene signature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> was significantly enriched after 12-36 hours of induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), including the canonical YAP target genes <italic>CYR61</italic> and <italic>ANKRD1</italic> that were significantly induced within 6h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, S3B).

Compared with the fast induction of the YAP target gene <italic>CYR61</italic>, we observed <italic>CCND1</italic> (cyclin D1) expression increasing only after 12-36 hours and only 1.4-fold. In comparison, the previously-reported suppressed gene <italic>DDIT4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> rapidly dropped whereas the expression of p27 (<italic>CDKN1B</italic>) and p21 (<italic>CDKN1A</italic>) changed only minimally over time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Since there was only a small fold change in cyclin D1 and p27 expression, we next tested whether cyclin D1 and p27 are more strongly regulated at the protein level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> following acute YAP-TEAD activation. LATS inhibitor treatment of serum-starved WT cells increased the nuclear/cytoplasmic YAP ratio and we confirmed the protein-level increase of select YAP targets (CDK6 and SKP2, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3E</xref>). LATS inhibition strongly increased cyclin D1 protein levels but also resulted in a small increase in p27 and transient decrease in p21 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, S3F). Over 3-12 hours following LATS stimulation, the increase in the cyclin D1/p27 ratio was paralleled by increasing Rb phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-G</xref>), and cells progressed to S-phase within 12-24 hours (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3G</xref>). Supporting that LATS signals through YAP-TEADs, TEAD inhibition reversed the LATSi-induced changes of these protein levels and reversed the percent of proliferating cells back to control levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, S3G).</p>
<p>We next inhibited TEAD in proliferating cells to determine how YAP-TEAD inhibition regulates cyclin D1 and p27 levels and Rb phosphorylation in G1 phase to terminate proliferation. We first confirmed that TEAD inhibition of CA-YAP cells, or of LATSi pre-treated WT cells, rapidly reduced the YAP ratio (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3H</xref>). Markedly, however, TEAD inhibition resulted in only a delayed reduction of the nuclear level of cyclin D1 protein in G1 phase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Moreover, TEAD inhibition caused a strong and slow increase of the nuclear protein levels of p27 and a relatively smaller increase in p21 levels across the population. Concordantly, the mean cyclin D1/p27 ratio and the G1 phase Rb phosphorylation both decreased but only after a delay with most cells arresting by 24-36 hours (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>, S3I). Moreover, single-cell analysis confirmed that the cyclin D1/p27 ratio still predicted whether Rb was phosphorylated in G1 as individual cells gradually reduced their cyclin D1 and increased their p27 level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, while acute YAP activation increases the cyclin D1/p27 ratio and triggers Rb phosphorylation relatively quickly, YAP inactivation in proliferating cells lowers the cyclin D1/p27 ratio and Rb phosphorylation only after a delay of 12 to 24 hours. This result raises the question of how YAP activity can induce such a prolonged increase in the cyclin D1/p27 ratio that keeps Rb hyperphosphorylated in G1-phase cells long after YAP has been inhibited.</p>

Indeed, the small portion of WT cells proliferated in the absence of mitogens could be inhibited by titration of the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib in the absence of exogenous EGF (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The EGFR inhibition also mirrored the TEAD inhibition, supporting that YAP-TEAD activity may signal through EGFR at low stimulation conditions to promote proliferation (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1G</xref>). However, EGFR inhibition in CA-YAP cells could only partially suppress Rb phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, Figure S4B), suggesting that additional receptor signaling pathways are contributing to the YAP-induced proliferation.</p>
<p>We next determined how rapidly TEAD inhibition changes the protein level of EGFR and AXL. Western blot analysis revealed that their total levels gradually decreased after TEAD inhibition in CA-YAP cells over a similar time scale as the loss of proliferation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Since EGFR levels were YAP dependent, we further tested whether YAP activation increases EGF sensitivity. Indeed, while EGF stimulation caused only a small increase in Rb phosphorylation in WT cells, Rb phosphorylation was much more strongly increased in CA-YAP cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Furthermore, while both WT and CA-YAP cells had similarly low basal AKT and ERK phosphorylation, the CA-YAP cells kept their phosphorylated AKT and ERK levels higher for at least 10 hours after EGF stimulation compared to WT cells, again consistent with sensitized EGF signaling (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). As a control, we also confirmed that TEAD inhibition of CA-YAP cells prevented this prolonged AKT and ERK signaling.</p>
<p>Finally, we tested whether there is an extended period of enhanced EGF signaling also after transient LATS inactivation upstream of YAP. We used WT cells pre-treated with LATSi and then either maintained (sustained) or washed out the LATSi prior to a 14-hour addition of EGF (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). While LATSi washout reduced the nuclear/cytoplasmic YAP ratio and nuclear YAP levels back to control conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, S4C), cells retained sensitivity to EGF for at least 14 hours, as evidenced by the increased p-Rb (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>, Figure S4D), S6 phosphorylation (p-S6, a readout of PI3K/mTOR activity, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>, S4E), and nuclear FRA1 levels (a readout of integrated MEK-ERK activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). In support of a general prolongation of proliferation signaling, we also found that transient LATSi treatment sustained the fraction of G1 cells with phosphorylated Rb after HGF and LPA stimulation (Figure S4F).</p>
<p>We conclude that YAP activity increases the activity of EGFR in the absence of added EGF in an autocrine manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, while also increasing the sensitivity of cells to exogenous EGF stimulation. This sensitization extends to other receptors since gefitinib could only suppress a fraction of the YAP-induced proliferation response. Notably, the increased EGFR signaling persisted for over 14 hours after YAP inactivation, suggesting that YAP is inducing a prolonged proliferation response since YAP inactivation only terminates proliferation and signaling after a delay.</p>

<p>In support of YAP regulating cyclin D1 protein levels in G1 phase through mTOR and MEK/ERK, rather than doing so directly, MEK inhibitor alone (Figure S5D) or the combined inhibition of MEK and mTOR fully reduced the cyclin D1 level in CA-YAP cells to the level of WT cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, S5E). A time course analysis showed that the drop in cyclin D1 levels is rapid after mTOR inhibition but slower and stronger after MEK inhibition even though both inhibitors rapidly suppressed p-S6 and p-ERK, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H-I</xref>). As mTOR can rapidly control translation of cyclin D1 mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, this fast regulation was anticipated. In contrast, mTOR inhibition did not alter p27 levels but MEK inhibition not only reduced cyclin D1 levels but also slowly and strongly increased p27 levels, explaining why MEK inhibition suppresses Rb phosphorylation more completely than the regulation of mTOR. Thus, transient YAP-mediated proliferation responses result from an increase and delayed decrease of the activity of EGFR and other receptors, which in turn transiently increases the cyclin D1/p27 ratio through reversibly regulating MEK-ERK and, to a lesser degree, mTOR signaling pathways.</p>

<title>Partial activation of YAP from ablating Merlin can be reversed by increased contact inhibition</title>
<p>To evaluate the robustness of the termination of YAP activation in monolayers, we increased YAP activity by ablating Merlin, an adaptor protein and tumor suppressor that indirectly activates LATS1/2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. We generated clonal Merlin knockout RPE1 cells (Merlin KO) using CRISPR/Cas9. As expected, these cells had increased nuclear localization of YAP that could be suppressed by TEAD inhibition (Figure S6A-B).</p>
<p>However, unlike CA-YAP, Merlin KO increased proliferation without abolishing contact inhibition of proliferation. Instead, a higher cell density was required to inhibit proliferation compared to WT, both at low and high serum levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, S6C). Moreover, inhibiting TEAD in Merlin KO cell suppressed Rb phosphorylation in both cases to levels similar as TEAD-inhibited WT cells (Figure S1G), supporting a model whereby Merlin regulates proliferation primarily through YAP-TEAD activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Importantly, we found that YAP activity in Merlin KO cells could be as effectively inhibited by contact inhibition as in WT cells but required a higher local cell density to reach the same YAP inhibition (both at low and high serum levels, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>We next examined the role of EGFR in the Merlin KO cells, as a possible mechanism mediating serum-independent proliferation downstream of the higher YAP signaling. Like CA-YAP cells, Merlin KO cells displayed activated EGFR signaling in the absence of added EGF, since the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib reduced the percentage of proliferating cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, S6D). Similar to the transiently LATS-inhibited cells, the Merlin KO cells had increased sensitivity to EGF while still retaining a strong local cell density dependence (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). In addition, we found increased proliferation in response to several other receptor tyrosine kinase ligands (Figure S6D), again consistent with YAP inducing a broad upregulation of receptor signals not limited to EGFR.</p>
<p>Finally, we found that Merlin KO cells still suppressed cyclin D1 and increased p27 levels at higher local cell density (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), demonstrating that these cells suppress proliferation through the same mechanism as WT cells: inhibiting YAP activity and downregulating mitogen signaling and the cyclin D1/p27 ratio (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). However, Merlin KO cells employ alternative mechanisms from inactivating Merlin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> to contact inhibit YAP.</p>
<p>We conclude that even though constitutive YAP activation abolished contact inhibition of proliferation, cells can robustly contact inhibit YAP-TEAD even if Hippo signaling is reduced and YAP activation increased. However, cells that have such an induced YAP activity now require higher local cell density to suppress YAP activity and proliferation.</p>

<title>DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Our study shows that contact inhibition of YAP and mitogen signaling control the cyclin D1/p27 ratio and cell cycle entry in G1 phase through a balance mechanism that shapes an intrinsically transient YAP-induced proliferation response (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Our study supports a model where YAP activation controls proliferation by gradually increasing the expression of HB-EGF and other RTK ligands, as well as various receptors and known regulators of mitogen signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. This regulation explains how YAP activation is increasing EGF and other mitogen signals in a cell autonomous manner (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), while simultaneously sensitizing cells to exogenous stimulation by EGF and other mitogens (Figure S4F, S6E), which is likely relevant for the role of YAP activation in the inflammatory injury response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. We further show that YAP activation increases downstream signaling through MEK-ERK signaling and, to an unexpectedly lesser degree, mTOR signaling, to control the nuclear protein levels of cyclin D1 and p27 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>). Most importantly, our study revealed a predominant role of both cyclin D1 and p27 in YAP-induced proliferation. We showed that YAP-stimulated cells decide in the G1 phase whether to enter the cell cycle by increasing the nuclear cyclin D1/p27 ratio above a critical activity threshold, or to remain quiescent or exit the cell cycle by staying below this threshold (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-E</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, as the YAP-induced cell division increases the local cell density, we show that the ensuing contact inhibition of YAP-TEAD causes a delayed inhibition of mitogen signaling, which lowers the cyclin D1/p27 ratio to terminate the proliferation response. Thus, there are two delay mechanisms ensuring a prolonged proliferation response: cells wait to inhibit YAP until cell division has increased the local cell density, then the resulting contact inhibition of YAP lowers the cyclin D1/p27 ratio and arrests proliferation after a delay (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). YAP signals often fluctuate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, and the slow integration of YAP signals further ensures that the proliferation response is robustly started and ended. Slow integration provides a filter mechanism which prevents short-lived YAP activity changes from triggering unwanted cell cycle entry or premature cell cycle exit.</p>
<p>We also evaluated the robustness of YAP inactivation by using ablation of Merlin/NF2, a suppressor of Hippo signaling to YAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. While Merlin has been shown to have additional signaling functions at the plasma membrane, our study shows that the increased EGFR signaling and proliferation in Merlin KO cells can be reversed by TEAD inhibition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that Merlin primarily signals through YAP-TEAD to control EGFR signaling, the cyclin D1/p27 ratio, and proliferation. In support that the termination of YAP signaling and proliferation is robust, our study shows that contact inhibition is merely shifted but not abolished when YAP activity is increased by ablation of Merlin, and cells can still effectively terminate proliferation but at higher local cell density. Moreover, since the loss of Merlin can boost proliferation without a loss of contact inhibition, this result also suggests that Merlin has a unique advantage as a drug target, since a potential Merlin inhibitor would trigger a self-limiting proliferation response. This could offer a safer alternative strategy to LATS inhibition, which was recently shown to cause a widespread and uncontrolled proliferation response and de-differentiation in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We also found that inhibiting MEK-ERK, rather than mTOR, in CA-YAP cells greatly reduces the cyclin D/p27 ratio and stops proliferation. This crucial role of MEK-ERK in YAP-induced proliferation was surprising, since oncogenic YAP mutants can drive resistance to KRAS inhibition and KRAS primarily regulates proliferation through MEK-ERK and mTOR activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. The resistance to KRAS inhibitor may therefore by mediated by YAP-mediated direct regulation of cell cycle entry. We confirmed that YAP activation can also directly induce cyclin D1 as well as SKP2, which can degrade p27<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Indeed, we found that this upregulation may be particularly important at high levels of YAP activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>, since DOX induction of CA-YAP in high serum conditions can still increase cyclin D1 and proliferation when MEK is inhibited (Figure S6F-G).</p>
<p>Our study also supports that YAP regulates proliferation through additional modulatory pathways described in previous studies. YAP gradually induces a number of Hippo pathway components such as LATS, Merlin and Angiomotin-like genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup> (Figure S6H-I), which likely contribute to the delayed downregulation of YAP along with the contact inhibition of YAP. Moreover, our finding that persistent activation of YAP suppresses contact inhibition of proliferation is supported by our own and previous RNAseq data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> showing that YAP activation not only increases mitogen signaling regulators but also reduces the expression of contact inhibition regulators at the plasma membrane such as ephrins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> and protocadherins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup> (Figure S6J-K), which may mediate cell density sensing. Finally, we showed the stress-regulated p21 CDK inhibitor can be rate-limiting in suppressing proliferation in some YAP-activated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), supporting a redundant role of both p27 and p21 inhibitors in promoting cell cycle exit.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>YAP activation must be transient to drive the epithelial regenerative response. Our study identifies a self-limiting control mechanism that allows YAP to trigger a commensurate proliferation response. We show that transient proliferation responses are initiated by YAP activation increasing EGF and mitogen signaling to increase the cyclin D1/p27 ratio above a critical threshold. The delayed contact inhibition-mediated inactivation of YAP then terminates proliferation by gradually lowering mitogen signaling and the cyclin D1/p27 ratio below this critical threshold (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). In contrast, we demonstrate that persistent inactivation of LATS1/2 or activation of YAP activity abolishes contact inhibition and promotes persistent mitogen signaling that keeps the cyclin D1/p27 ratio high, explaining how oncogenic mutations that constitutively inactivate LATS1/2 or activate YAP elicit unrestricted proliferation.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>We identified cyclin D1 and p27 as the primary regulators of Rb phosphorylation for RPE1 cells in response to contact inhibition and serum starvation with an added contribution from p21. In other cell types and cancer models, additional phosphorylation, degradation, and translation-mediated control steps may further contribute to the timing and overall level of proliferation. We also studied EGFR signaling as a representative effector of YAP, but our data suggest a pleiotropic effect on additional receptors and cell adhesion pathways, which likely affect the activity of Merlin and other adaptor proteins at the plasma membrane and feed into the dynamics of different mitogen responses. Furthermore, as our mechanistic studies required in vitro, single-cell experiments, how these control mechanisms of the proliferation response apply to various animal models of epithelial repair remains to be determined. Finally, in addition to Merlin, other adaptor proteins like angiomotin and cytoskeleton regulators like RhoA, can regulate YAP activity in response to cell density changes. Future work is also needed to understand specific contributions from such regulators and when they engage to restrict or promote YAP-TEAD activity.</p>

<title>RNA sequencing experimental conditions</title>
<p>WT and doxycycline-inducible YAP5SA cells were seeded at 38,000 cells per well of 96-well, optical-grade plates (Sigma-Aldrich Cat&#x0023;CLS3904) in 1.0&#x0025; FBS. After &#x223C;2h to allow time for adherence to the tissue culture surface, cells were washed with 0.1&#x0025; FBS then pre-arrested with CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib, 1 uM, SelleckChem CAT&#x0023;S1116) in either 1.0&#x0025; FBS or 0.1&#x0025; FBS for 28-36h prior to doxycycline (500 ng/mL, Sigma-Aldrich CAT&#x0023;D9891) induction or DMSO control treatment for 6, 12, 24, or 36h in the presence of CDK4/6 inhibitor to maintain cells in G0 and prevent additional transcriptional variation due to cell cycle progression. Each experiment (repeated on three separate occasions) was performed in technical duplicate (with 6 replicate wells per technical duplicate), reserving one replicate for immunofluorescence staining to confirm quality of cell cycle arrest (by DNA content and EdU incorporation) and the other for harvesting RNA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s8k">
<title>RNA-seq and analysis</title>
<p>Prior to harvesting, 96-well plates were washed with PBS, aspirated fully and transferred immediately to &#x2212;80C. RNA was later harvested from the plates by briefly thawing prior to using extraction by RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen Cat&#x0023; 74106) and QIAshredder (Qiagen Cat&#x0023;79654), with pooling of 6 technical replicate wells/condition directly following the lysis step prior to following the manufacturer protocol, including the optional DNase treatment (Qiagen Cat&#x0023; 79254).</p>
<p>Samples were eluted in ultraPure ddH2O and assessed for quality using an Agilent Bioanalyzer TapeStation. Illumina Stranded mRNA library preparation with polyA capture and sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq6000 system (paired-end, 2 x 50) at the Weill Cornell Genome Resources Core Facility over two rounds to get sufficient read depth.</p>
<p>Raw reads were checked for quality using FASTQC then aligned to the human genome assembly (GRCh38) with HISAT2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup> and assigned to genomic features with featureCounts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. Differential expression analysis was conducted with DESeq2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="s8l">
<title>Image quantifications and analysis</title>
<p>Illumination bias correction, nuclear segmentation, image cropping and alignment across iterative rounds of immunofluorescence, and analysis were performed with a custom MATLAB pipeline (previously published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> and deposited on Github: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MeyerLab/image-analysis-ratnayeke-2021">https://github.com/MeyerLab/image-analysis-ratnayeke-2021</ext-link>) incorporating local density measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. For illumination bias correction, images of background autofluorescence from immunofluorescence blocking solution in cell-free wells were taken for each experiment and used to flatten raw images. Cell nuclei were automatically segmented using Hoechst staining, a Gaussian filter, and a curvature-based object splitting algorithm. A segmentation mask from the first round of imaging was used to align subsequent imaging rounds and crop the images for the overlapping regions. Image jitter between 4i rounds was typically less than 500 nm.</p>
<p>For nuclear-localized protein stains (EdU, cyclin D1, p27, phospho-Rb, c-Myc, Fra1, SKP2, CDK6, p21), global background subtraction was performed automatically by expanding a 7.8 &#x03BC;m ring from the nuclear mask and subtracting the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile of pixel signal as estimated background. For protein stains with cytoplasmic and nuclear localization (YAP, phospho-S6, phospho-AKT, phospho-ERK, N-cadherin), median background signal was estimated during analysis by manual averaging of background pixels of representative cell-free regions and subtracting as a flat threshold. For quantification of immunofluorescence signals, DNA content was calculated as the total nuclear Hoechst intensity (median intensity x nuclear area); nuclear fluorescence signals were calculated as the median nuclear intensity; cytoplasmic fluorescence signals were calculated as the median cytoplasmic intensity (expanding the nuclear mask with a ring of inner radius 0.65 um and outer radius 3.23 um to minimize the chance of sampling cytoplasm of neighboring cells). To compare experimental replicates, fold-change in immunofluorescence staining was used to account for the variation in staining and real fluorescence unit values.</p>
<p>Cell gating for G1-phase cells was performed by distinguishing G0/G1 and G2 cell populations by 2N or 4N DNA context, then selecting cells below the EdU-incorporation threshold (see sample EdU histograms, Figure S1B) with 2N DNA. Otherwise, for calculating percent EdU-positive or percent Rb phosphorylated (all-cell gating), cells across cell cycle phases were analyzed together. Rb phosphorylation was defined by histogram analysis of the bifurcated phospho-Rb stain and calculating the fraction of cells above the threshold cutoff (see sample p-Rb histograms, Figure S1B).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s8m">
<title>Local cell density analysis</title>
<p>Local cell density analysis was adapted from Fan et al., 2021. Briefly, local density was measured by dividing imaging sites (25-30 tiled images/well) into a 3D histogram based on the centroid coordinates of segmented nuclei (10 x 10 grid, MATLAB hist3). The xy location coordinates of each cell centroid were rounded and the number of cells per block was automatically counted, then scaled back to match the original image size (giving numerical output rather than integer values)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The local cell density value assigned for each cell was based on the scaled number of cells in its assigned local density block.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s8n">
<title>Quantification corrections</title>
<p>While cells were counted prior to seeding, final cell plating density varied across experiments, and absolute proliferation levels varied per independent experiment. We therefore assessed both absolute (&#x0025; EdU, &#x0025; p-Rb) and fold-change proliferation metrics for assessing drug and condition effect sizes.</p>
<p>During the iterative steps of multiplexed immunofluorescence, some cells washed off during later rounds of imaging. As a proxy for null cells, cells that were segmented from the first round of imaging were gated out of the final analysis if their Hoechst value was less than 100 RFU for a subsequent imaging round.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s8o">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using Student&#x2019;s one-sample or paired (MATLAB ttest) and two-sample (MATLAB ttest2) t tests. Linear regressions for data binned by local cell density were performed using fitlm (MATLAB). 95&#x0025; confidence intervals and SEM are plotted as indicated for representative experiments and summary data.</p>
